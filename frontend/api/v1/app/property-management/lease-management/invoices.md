Example request:

```json
{
  "lease_id": 101,
  "due_at": "2026-03-01",
  "notes": "March 2026 billing",
  "cu_reference_number": "INV-REF-3001",
  "items": [
    {
      "lease_item_component_id": 455,
      "notes": "Base rent",
      "quantity": 1,
      "amount": 950,
      "tax_id": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "message": "Invoice created successfully",
  "invoice": {
    "id": 9001,
    "lease": { "id": 101 },
    "amount": 950,
    "tax": 152,
    "total": 1102,
    "status": { "value": "pending", "color": "secondary" }
  }
}
```

## Update Invoice

`PUT/PATCH /api/v1/app/{company}/property-management/lease-management/invoices/{invoice}`

Use the same payload shape as create.

## Cancel Invoice

`PATCH /api/v1/app/{company}/property-management/lease-management/invoices/{invoice}/cancel`

No request body required.

Possible status values returned by API resource:

- `pending` (`secondary`)
- `unpaid` (`warning`)
- `partially paid` (`primary`)
- `paid` (`success`)
- `cancelled` (`danger`)

## Sign Invoice (ETR)

`POST /api/v1/app/{company}/property-management/lease-management/invoices/{invoice}/sign`

Signs the invoice on the property's ETR (KRA fiscal) device and stores the CU details on the invoice. No request body.

The device comes from the property's `esd_type` / `esd_config` (see Facilities). A property with no device set uses the system default (Incotex). The seller PIN sent to the device is always the **landlord's KRA PIN**, and the buyer PIN is the tenant's.

When to show the action: `permissions.sign` on the invoice resource is `true`. It is `false` when:

- the user lacks the `sign-facility-invoice` permission
- the invoice is `pending` (awaiting approval) or `cancelled`
- the invoice is already signed (`cu_invoice_number` is set)

Signing runs as a queued job. On a synchronous queue (the default locally) the request returns after the device answers; on a real queue it returns straight away and the CU fields fill in once the job runs. Refetch the invoice (or poll `GET /invoices/{invoice}`) until `etr_signed_at` or `etr_error` is set.

Success response (`200`):

```json
{
  "message": "Invoice signed successfully",
  "invoice": {
    "id": 9001,
    "cu_invoice_number": "0010000042",
    "cu_serial_number": "KRAMW017202209000001",
    "cu_invoice_verify_url": "https://itax.kra.go.ke/KRA-Portal/invoiceChk.htm?actionCode=loadPage&invoiceNo=0010000042",
    "etr_signed_at": {
      "raw": "2026-09-22T10:15:00.000000Z",
      "formatted": "22 Sep, 2026 10:15",
      "diff": "1 second ago"
    },
    "etr_error": null,
    "permissions": { "sign": false }
  }
}
```

When the job is queued rather than run inline, `message` is `"Invoice queued for ETR signing"` and the CU fields are still `null`.

Errors:

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| `403` | `permissions.sign` is `false` | standard forbidden response |
| `422` | The device refused the invoice, could not be reached, or the invoice cannot be signed as it stands | `{ "message": "...", "errors": { "etr": ["<reason>"] } }` |

Typical `errors.etr` reasons:

- `The landlord of this property has no KRA PIN.`: add the PIN on the landlord, then sign again.
- `No URL is configured for the incotex ETR device.`: set the property's `esd_config.url` (or ask for the default device to be configured).
- `The incotex ETR device rejected the document (HTTP 4xx): ...`: the device's own message follows.

The last failure is also saved on the invoice as `etr_error`, so show it next to the Sign button. Signing again clears it.

ETR fields on the invoice resource:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cu_invoice_number` | string\|null | CU invoice number from the device |
| `cu_serial_number` | string\|null | CU serial number |
| `cu_invoice_verify_url` | string\|null | KRA verification URL (render as a QR code) |
| `etr_signed_at` | object\|null | `{ raw, formatted, diff }` when the system signed it |
| `etr_error` | string\|null | Reason the last signing attempt failed |

## Delete Invoice

`DELETE /api/v1/app/{company}/property-management/lease-management/invoices/{invoice}`

## Dispute Invoice

`POST /api/v1/app/{company}/property-management/lease-management/invoices/{invoice}/dispute`

Request body:

| Field | Required | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `details` | Yes | string | Dispute description |
| `ticket_upload_id` | No | integer | Optional attachment upload id (`uploads.id`) |

## Withdraw Invoice Dispute
